When you write a Go module and want to share it, the easiest way is to host it on a public GitHub repository. Your colleagues can then fetch and import it directly with `go get`.

## Option 1: Single Module with Multiple Packages (Recommended)

### Structure

```
goPackage/
  go.mod
  mod1/
    mod1.go
  mod2/
    mod2.go
```

Initialize module at the root:

```bash
go mod init github.com/your-username/goPackage
```

### Usage by colleagues

Fetch module:

```bash
go get github.com/your-username/goPackage@latest
```

Import in code:

```go
import (
    "github.com/your-username/goPackage/mod1"
    "github.com/your-username/goPackage/mod2"
)
```

Best for a single library with multiple subpackages.

## Option 2: Multiple Independent Modules

### Structure

```
goPackage/
  mod1/
    go.mod
    mod1.go
  mod2/
    go.mod
    mod2.go
```

Initialize module separately for each:

```bash
cd mod1 && go mod init github.com/your-username/goPackage/mod1
cd mod2 && go mod init github.com/your-username/goPackage/mod2
```

### Usage by colleagues

Fetch separately:

```bash
go get github.com/your-username/goPackage/mod1@latest
go get github.com/your-username/goPackage/mod2@latest
```

Import in code:

```go
import (
    "github.com/your-username/goPackage/mod1"
    "github.com/your-username/goPackage/mod2"
)
```

Useful when each sub-package should be versioned independently.

## Recommendation

- If your repo is one library with multiple packages → Use Option 1.
    
- If your repo is a collection of unrelated modules → Use Option 2.
