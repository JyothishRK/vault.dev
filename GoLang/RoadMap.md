    - Install Go, set up your GOPATH, Go Modules.
        
    - Learn how `go run`, `go build`, `go test`, and `go mod` work.
        
    - Understand the Go project structure.
        
2. **Core Language Concepts**
    
    - Variables, constants, data types
        
    - Control flow (`if`, `for`, `switch`)
        
    - Functions & multiple return values
        
    - Pointers (Go‚Äôs unique approach)
        
    - Structs, interfaces, embedding
        
    - Error handling (`error` interface, idiomatic `if err != nil`)
        
3. **Collections**
    
    - Arrays, slices, maps
        
    - Strings (UTF-8 handling, runes)
        
4. **Go Routines & Channels (Concurrency Basics)**
    
    - `go` keyword for goroutines
        
    - Channels: unbuffered, buffered
        
    - `select` for multiplexing
        
    - Context for cancellation
        
5. **Hands-On Mini Projects**
    
    - Build a CLI todo app
        
    - Simple file reader/writer
        
    - Goroutine-based worker pool

    - Use `gorilla/mux` or `chi` router
        
    - Implement middlewares (logging, auth)
        
5. **Database Integration**
    
    - SQL with `database/sql`
        
    - Use Postgres or MySQL
        
    - Learn `sqlx` or `gorm` ORM
        
    - Connection pooling, transactions
        
6. **Hands-On Projects**
    
    - URL shortener service
        
    - Blog API with CRUD operations
        
    - REST API with authentication
